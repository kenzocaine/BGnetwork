# BGnetwork
Basal Ganlgia Model based on Lindahl 2016

Under the folder "BGcore/Model" exists 2 base classes from which every other simulation setup can be derived.
Please specify sys path and param.py file for each set-up.

From Simulation/Template you can easily derive any simulation set-up according to your needs. Any class you make must be derived from either BGnodes or BGnetwork and then created in the main file.
